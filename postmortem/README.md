My first postmortem


Issue Summary:

Duration: March 10, 2024, 3:00 PM - March 11, 2024, 8:00 AM (UTC)
Impact: The web application experienced intermittent downtime, with services being unavailable for approximately 17 hours. Users encountered slow loading times and frequent timeouts, affecting nearly 80% of the user base.
Root Cause: The outage was caused by a database server overload due to a surge in traffic combined with inefficient database queries.


Timeline:


March 10, 2024, 3:00 PM (UTC): Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating increased server response times.
March 10, 2024, 3:15 PM (UTC): Engineers began investigating the issue, suspecting a potential database bottleneck.
March 10, 2024, 4:30 PM (UTC): Misleading assumption led to focusing on network latency issues rather than database performance.
March 10, 2024, 6:00 PM (UTC): Incident escalated to senior database administrators and system administrators for further investigation.
March 10, 2024, 8:00 PM (UTC): Correct root cause identified as database server overload due to inefficient queries.
March 11, 2024, 2:00 AM (UTC): Mitigation steps initiated to optimize database queries and scale up server resources.
March 11, 2024, 8:00 AM (UTC): Services restored to normal operation after implementing performance optimizations.


Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was an inefficient database query execution plan, leading to excessive resource utilization on the database server.
Resolution: The issue was addressed by optimizing database queries, restructuring indexes, and increasing server resources to handle the surge in traffic. Additionally, query caching mechanisms were implemented to improve overall database performance.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:


Improvements/Fixes:


Optimize database queries regularly to ensure efficient execution plans.
Implement query caching mechanisms to reduce database load during peak traffic periods.
Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to detect database performance issues proactively.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Conduct a thorough review of all database queries to identify and optimize inefficient ones.
Implement query caching mechanisms to alleviate database server load during traffic spikes.
Enhance monitoring alerts to provide early detection of database performance degradation.
Schedule regular performance reviews and optimizations for critical database systems.
Document incident response procedures for similar scenarios to expedite resolution in the future.
